# BusyCow Playbooks

Agent-ready setup and skill bundles for BusyCow clients.

## Stack

All playbooks assume this stack:
- **[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/BusyCow/hermes-agent)** — AI agent runtime
- **[Lark / Feishu](https://www.larksuite.com)** — Data backend (Bitable bases)
- **[GBrain](https://github.com/BusyCow/gbrain)** — Long-term knowledge base (SSOT)

---

## Installation Order

```
Step 0: Prerequisites   (manual — do this before anything else)
Step 1: setup/          (Hermes + GBrain config)
Step 2: core/           (system skills + management bases)
Step 3: playbooks/X/    (pick one or more business playbooks)
```

Tell your agent the raw GitHub URL for each `SETUP.md` and it will run the setup automatically.
