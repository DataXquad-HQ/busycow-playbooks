## Step 2 — Install Sales Skills

Fetch and install each skill:

```

2. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BusyCow/busycow-playbooks/main/playbooks/sales/skills/logging-sales-activities.md
3. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BusyCow/busycow-playbooks/main/playbooks/sales/skills/managing-sales-pipeline.md

5. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BusyCow/busycow-playbooks/main/playbooks/sales/skills/generating-quotations.md
```

## Step 3 — Register in Skills Registry

Add each skill to the Skills Registry (from Core Playbook):

| Name | Source | Category |
|------|--------|----------|
| capturing-sales-intel | our own | Sales |
| logging-sales-activities | our own | Sales |
| managing-sales-pipeline | our own | Sales |
| managing-partnership-pipeline | our own | Sales |
| generating-quotations | our own | Sales |

## Step 4 — Verify

- "Show me my accounts table" → agent should query the Accounts table
- "Log a quick call with [name]" → should trigger `logging-sales-activities`
- "Add a new contact" → should trigger `capturing-sales-intel`

## Done

Your Sales CRM is ready. Example interactions:

> "剛跟 [公司] 的 [姓名] 開了個會，他們對我們的產品很有興趣"
> "幫我記一個新客戶：[公司名]，在香港做 RFID 的"
> "Onnet 這個 partner 現在什麼狀況？"
> "幫我出一份 quotation 給 [客戶]"
