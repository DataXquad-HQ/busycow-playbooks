> **Format note:** Every field entry below includes:
> - `type` — the Twenty field type used when creating via API or Settings → Data Model
> - `options` — valid values for SELECT / MULTI_SELECT fields (written as the `value` key in Twenty's API)
> - `description` — what this field is for; this text maps directly to the `description` property when creating fields via the metadata API

## Standard Objects (built into Twenty)

These exist in every fresh Twenty workspace. No setup needed — only extend with custom fields.

| Object | GraphQL query | Purpose |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Company | `companies` | Account master record — clients, prospects, partners |
| Person | `people` | Individual contact |
| Opportunity | `opportunities` | Sales deal / pipeline opportunity |
| Note | `notes` | Information record — meeting summaries, research, intel (Twenty built-in) |
| Task | `tasks` | Action items with due dates and assignees |

**Note vs Task convention:**
Use `note` for *information* (meeting summaries, intel, research output).
Use `task` for *actions* (follow-ups, deadlines, assignments).
These built-in objects have full Timeline and relation support in Twenty UI.

## Custom Objects

Create via Settings → Data Model or via the metadata API.

| Object singular | Plural | GraphQL query | Purpose |
|----------------|--------|--------------|---------|
| `partnership` | `partnerships` | `partnerships` | Partner relationship lifecycle — resellers, integrators, technical providers |
| `engagement` | `engagements` | `engagements` | Customer / partner interaction record — call, meeting, email, event |
| `quotation` | `quotations` | `quotations` | Sales quotation document |
| `quotationItem` | `quotationItems` | `quotationItems` | Line items within a quotation |
| `contract` | `contracts` | `contracts` | Signed agreement document |

| 2026-06-11 | Full rewrite — aligned to live Twenty instance. Added Partnership, Engagement, Contract objects. Extended Company, Person, Opportunity, Task. Added field types, options, and descriptions throughout. Renamed `description` → `overview` on Company (bio vs enrichment distinction). Removed `businessLine` from shared schema (product-specific, not universal). Added Note and Task conventions. |
